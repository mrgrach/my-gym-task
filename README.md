# my-gym-task

We would like you to revisit the “Add Product” form from Task 1, this time to demonstrate your
ability to write automated tests. Please implement your solution using either Playwright or
Cypress, with JS, TS or Python as the language driving the API.
You should focus on demonstrating a clean, maintainable design. Given the time constraints, we
do not expect you to build an exhaustive solution, but we do expect you to take a
well-rationalized approach to prioritizing what you choose to deliver.

Please provide the solution as a zipped Git repository, with any relevant instructions for
executing the test in a file named INSTRUCTIONS.md. An incremental commit history that
communicates your steps, and shows good version control, would be considered a plus.
